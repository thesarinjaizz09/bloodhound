# üê∫ BloodHound - Active Directory Enumeration Tool

BloodHound is a powerful tool designed to map and analyze Active Directory (AD) environments. It helps penetration testers, red teamers, and security professionals to identify attack paths and privilege escalation opportunities within Active Directory networks. BloodHound provides a graphical interface to visualize these attack paths, making it a crucial tool for AD security assessments.

## üîç What is BloodHound?

BloodHound is an open-source tool that uses graph theory to model Active Directory (AD) permissions and identify attack paths within the network. It allows attackers (ethical ones in this case) to visualize relationships and privileges between users, groups, and machines within an Active Directory environment. By analyzing these paths, security professionals can identify weaknesses and potential privilege escalation vectors.
